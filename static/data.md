# Random Values

- "I was reading a book, but then I got distracted by my e-reader’s potential. Now I'm lost in a digital library, contemplating my next literary adventure. Please, no spoilers. I’m still figuring out what to read."
- "Once upon a time, I was reading a book. Now I’m lost in a labyrinth of e-books, trying to figure out which one will be my next escape. It’s a good problem to have, right?"
- "My toddler may not understand the magic of eBooks, but at least they can't rip the pages out! E-readers are great for avoiding book destruction, but they lack the charm of a toddler’s giggle when they reach the ‘end’ and demand another story."
- "Paperbacks are perfect for snuggling up and flipping through together—unless your toddler wants to 'help' and rips every page with out. But eBooks?
- "If you touch that e-reader, you'll trigger an existential crisis—it's already trying to decide if it's a book or a screen."
